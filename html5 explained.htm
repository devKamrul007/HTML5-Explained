<!-- This is how a comment is written in HTML. -->
<!-- Comments about a line of code are usually written above the line.
     There are some exceptions like Doctype declaration (see line 25). -->

<!-- What is HTML?
     First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. 
     HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. 
     Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. 
     Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.

     HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images 
     so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look. 
     Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. -->

<!-- What is HTML5?
     HTML5 is the update made to HTML from HTML4 (XHTML follows a different version numbering scheme). 
     It uses the same basic rules as HTML4, but adds some new tags and attributes which allow for better 
     semantics and for dynamic elements that are activated using JavaScript. -->
     
<!-- Document Type Declaration for HTML5. -->
<!-- Document Type Declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document.
     So, you must remove all these comments from before the doctype declaretion. -->
<!-- Doctype instructs the browser about the version of HTML the page is written in. -->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. -->
<!-- The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements -->
<!-- The attribute "lang" is a Global Attribute which defines the language of the eliment.
     The value of this attribute is the language_code of the selected language.
     Like, "en" is for English, "bn" is for Bengaly, "ar" is for Arabic etc. -->

<!-- Global Attributes can be used with any html tag.
     They are not specific to any perticular tag. -->

    <!-- The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the
         document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets. -->

        <!-- The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be
             represented by other HTML meta-related elements,
             like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>. -->

        <!-- Charset declares the page's character encoding. -->
        <!-- Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8. -->
        <!-- The <meta> element declaring the encoding must be inside the <head> element
             and within the first 1024 bytes of the HTML. -->
        <!-- It is strongly recommended to define the character encoding.
             If a page's encoding is undefined, cross-scripting techniques are possible,
             such as the UTF-7 fallback cross-scripting technique. -->

        <!-- "name" attribute defines the name of a piece of document-level metadata.

        <!-- In Internet Explorer "X-UA-Compatible" specifies legacy document modes.
             This allows a webpage to be displayed as if it were viewed by an
