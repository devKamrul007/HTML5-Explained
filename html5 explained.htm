     Using angle brackets, exclamation mark and dashes. 
     Your code comment sites inbetween. -->
     
<!-- Comments about a line of code are usually written above the line.
     There are some exceptions like Doctype declaration (see line 75). -->
     
<!-- What is Markup?
     The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper 
     manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally 
     written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.  -->

<!-- What is Hypertext and Hypermedia?
     Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was 
     coined by Ted Nelson around 1965. Hyper Media is a term used for 
     hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, 
     video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to 
     use this term too. -->

<!-- What is a Markup Language?
     In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for 
     annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable 
     from the text. -->
 
<!-- What is HTML?
     Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for 
     creating web pages and web applications.
     
     First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for HyperText 
     Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents 
     (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page 
     contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. 
     Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version 
     of HTML code or another.

     HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images 
     so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended 
     to look. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text 
     as elements or load images or other elements. -->

<!-- Embeding Scripts:
     **
     HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as 
     JavaScript, PHP etc. which affects the behavior and content of web 
     pages.
     **

     Note that, to embed PHP within HTML, you need to associate PHP with 
     .html and .htm files on your server. Add the line bellow to your 
     Apache config:

         AddType application/x-httpd-php .html
    
     Or, you can simply change the file extension to dot php and type HTML 
     within dot php file and embed php code within this HTML. -->

<!-- What is HTML5?
     HTML5 is the update made to HTML from HTML4 (XHTML follows a different version numbering scheme). 
     It uses the same basic rules as HTML4, but adds some new tags and attributes which allow for better 
     semantics and for dynamic elements that are activated using JavaScript. -->

<!-- What's new in HTML5? 
     New elements include section, <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <bdi>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, 
     <embed>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <footer>, <header>, <keygen>, <mark>, <meter>, <nav>, <output>, 
     <progress>, <rp>, <rt>, <ruby>, <time>, <track>, <video>, and <wbr>. 
     There are also new input types for forms, which include tel, search, url, email, datetime, 
     date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color.
     
     With the increasing movement to keep structure and style separate, a number of styling elements 
     have been removed along with those that had accessibility issues or saw very little use. 
     These following elements should no longer be used in HTML code: <acronym>, <applet>, 
     <basefont>, <big>, <center>, <dir>, <font>, <frame>, <frameset>, <noframes>, <strike>, and <tt>. 

     HTML5 also simplifies the doctype declaration to the tag in the following box. -->
     
<!-- Document Type Declaration for HTML5. -->
<!-- Document Type Declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document.
     So, you must remove all these comments from before the doctype declaretion. -->
<!-- Doctype instructs the browser about the version of HTML the page is written in. -->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. -->
<!-- The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements -->
<!-- The attribute "lang" is a Global Attribute which defines the language of the eliment.
     The value of this attribute is the language_code of the selected language.
     Like, "en" is for English, "bn" is for Bengaly, "ar" is for Arabic etc. -->

<!-- Global Attributes can be used with any html tag.
     They are not specific to any perticular tag. -->

        <!-- The <meta> element declaring the encoding must be inside the <head> element
             and within the first 1024 bytes of the HTML. -->
        <!-- It is strongly recommended to define the character encoding.
             If a page's encoding is undefined, cross-scripting techniques are possible,
             such as the UTF-7 fallback cross-scripting technique. -->

        <!-- Meta description tag is important for search engines. Google sometimes
